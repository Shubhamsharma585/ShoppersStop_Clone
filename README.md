# Shoppersstop (clone) 🌐

**Shoppersstop.com** is an Indian department store chain, which is an E-Commerce platform owned by the K Raheja Corp. There are 86 stores across 40 cities in India, with clothing, accessories, handbags, shoes, jewellery, fragrances, cosmetics, health and beauty products, home furnishing and decor products.

In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of **Shoppersstop.com**. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned so far in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end and back end with high precision and quality.
