# Shoppersstop (clone) üåê

**Shoppersstop.com** is an Indian department store chain, which is an E-Commerce platform owned by the K Raheja Corp. There are 86 stores across 40 cities in India, with clothing, accessories, handbags, shoes, jewellery, fragrances, cosmetics, health and beauty products, home furnishing and decor products.
